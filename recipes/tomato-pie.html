    <h3>How it could look like, when finished</h3>
    <p>Cheesy tomato basil pie is a summer staple at my house I always make two: one for me and one to give away. Use fat-free mayonnaise to cut down on oliness (and calories!).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9inch) refrigerated pie crust (such als Pillsbury</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>    
        <li>5 Roma tomatoies, or more to taste, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 cup loosely packed basil leaves, coarsely chopped (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fat-free mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>8 whole basil leaves (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 230 C°.</li>
        <li>Press pie crust into a 9-inch pan or glass pie plate; fold excess dough under and press to form a thick edge. Cover edges with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese over the bottom. Reduce oven temperature to 190 C°.</li>
        <li>Drain tomato wedges in a colander or on paper towels. Arrange tomato wedges in the pie shell. Sprinkle basil and garlic on top.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese and pepper in a mixing bowl. Spread evenly over tomatoes; do not spread onto crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Cover edges with a ring of foil to keep from overcooking if needed. Garnish pie with whole basil leaves and serve warm.</li>
